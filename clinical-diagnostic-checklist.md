# Clinical Diagnostic Checklist for Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS)

## Purpose
This checklist is designed to assist pediatricians and other healthcare providers in systematically evaluating the three core diagnostic domains of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS): facial features, growth deficits, and central nervous system abnormalities. It follows the guidelines established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).

## 1. Facial Features
Characteristic facial dysmorphology is a hallmark of FAS. The presence of **all three** of the following features is required for a diagnosis of FAS with confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure; however, atypical cases may present with partial features.

### Checklist
- [ ] **Smooth philtrum** – The vertical groove between the nose and upper lip is poorly developed or absent.
  - *Assessment*: Use the Lip‑Philtrum Guide (LPG) developed by the University of Washington. A rating of 4 or 5 on the LPG indicates a smooth philtrum.
  - *Photo example*: [Link to example image](https://example.com/philtrum.png)
- [ ] **Thin vermilion border** – The red part of the upper lip is thin.
  - *Assessment*: Compare with standard photographs; a rating of 4 or 5 on the LPG indicates thin vermilion.
  - *Photo example*: [Link to example image](https://example.com/vermillion.png)
- [ ] **Short palpebral fissures** – Eye‑opening length is at or below the 10th percentile for age and ethnic group.
  - *Assessment*: Measure inner canthus to outer canthus distance (palpebral fissure length). Use age‑ and ethnicity‑appropriate normative tables (e.g., Hall et al., 2006).
  - *Photo example*: [Link to example image](https://example.com/palpebral.png)

### Documentation
- Record measurements and LPG ratings in the patient’s chart.
- Note any other craniofacial anomalies (e.g., epicanthal folds, low nasal bridge, micrognathia).

## 2. Growth Deficits
Prenatal and/or postnatal growth impairment is a key diagnostic criterion.

### Checklist
- [ ] **Prenatal growth deficiency** – Birth weight, length, or head circumference ≤ 10th percentile for gestational age.
  - *Assessment*: Review birth records and adjust for gestational age using standardized growth charts (e.g., WHO, CDC).
- [ ] **Postnatal growth deficiency** – Weight, height, or head circumference ≤ 10th percentile for age on at least one occasion after birth.
  - *Assessment*: Plot measurements on current CDC growth charts; repeat measurements at subsequent visits to confirm persistence.
- [ ] **Disproportional growth** – Head circumference disproportionately affected relative to weight/height.

### Documentation
- Plot growth curves for weight, height, and head circumference.
- Note any catch‑up growth or failure to thrive.

## 3. Central Nervous System (CNS) Abnormalities
CNS involvement may be structural, neurological, or functional. At least **one** of the following domains must be impaired.

### Checklist
#### Structural
- [ ] **Microcephaly** – Head circumference ≤ 10th percentile for age and sex.
- [ ] **Brain imaging abnormalities** – MRI findings such as reduced corpus callosum size, cerebellar hypoplasia, or abnormal basal ganglia.
  - *When to image*: Consider MRI if clinical suspicion is high or if neurological symptoms are present.

#### Neurological
- [ ] **Seizures** – Not attributable to another cause.
- [ ] **Poor coordination / motor delays** – Assess with standardized tools (e.g., PDMS‑2, BOT‑2).
- [ ] **Sensory processing difficulties** – Parent/teacher reports of oversensitivity to sound, touch, etc.

#### Functional (Neurodevelopmental)
- [ ] **Cognitive impairment** – Full‑scale IQ ≤ 70, or significant discrepancy between verbal and performance scales.
- [ ] **Executive dysfunction** – Difficulties with planning, working memory, inhibitory control (assess with BRIEF, D‑KEFS).
- [ ] **Academic underachievement** – Performance significantly below expected grade level in reading, math, or writing.
- [ ] **Attention deficits / hyperactivity** – Meet DSM‑5 criteria for ADHD; consider Vanderbilt or Conners rating scales.
- [ ] **Social‑communication deficits** – Impaired pragmatic language, difficulty interpreting social cues, peer‑relationship problems.

### Documentation
- Summarize findings from neurological exam, developmental assessments, and psychometric testing.
- Specify which domain(s) are impaired and the severity (mild, moderate, severe).

## 4. Confirmation of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure
Although not required for the diagnosis of FAS when all three physical domains are present, documentation of alcohol exposure strengthens the diagnosis.

- [ ] **Maternal history** – Direct report of alcohol consumption during pregnancy.
- [ ] **Medical records** – Documentation of alcohol‑related conditions in pregnancy (e.g., alcohol‑related birth defects).
- [ ] **Social/legal records** – Child‑protective services reports indicating alcohol use during pregnancy.

## 5. Differential Diagnosis
Rule out other conditions that can mimic FAS:
- [ ] Genetic syndromes (e.g., Williams syndrome, Noonan syndrome)
- [ ] Other teratogenic exposures (e.g., anticonvulsants, retinoic acid)
- [ ] Prematurity with intrauterine growth restriction
- [ ] Metabolic disorders

## 6. Recommended Referrals
- **Genetics** – For confirmatory evaluation and exclusion of other syndromes.
- **Neurology** – If seizures, abnormal tone, or structural brain abnormalities are suspected.
- **Developmental‑behavioral pediatrics** – For comprehensive neurodevelopmental assessment.
- **Occupational / Physical therapy** – For motor coordination and sensory integration.
- **Speech‑language pathology** – For language and pragmatic communication deficits.
- **Mental health** – For behavioral, emotional, or family‑support needs.
